# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (unreleased)

- Added a `--version` and `-V` flag to display the version of lon.
- Added the ability to freeze sources so that they are not updated via `lon
  update`. Sources can be frozen when they're added by providing the flag
  `--frozen` or they can be frozen or unfrozen later by calling `lon freeze`
  and `lon unfreeze` respectively.
